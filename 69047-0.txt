INTRODUCTION


    Tiddly Winks is a little fairy,
    And he sings like a canary.
    Another fairy is Tiddly Wee,
    He is just as cunning as can be.
    Tiddly Thrift is a saving mite,
    He wears a jacket snug and bright.
    Tiddly Cheer-Up with smiling face,
    Is always welcome any place.
    Tiddly Scowl looks at you and me,
    He is just as cross as he can be.
    Tiddly Why will make you sigh,
    He asks questions, My! Oh My!

    A child can read if he stops and thinks,
    So say the little Tiddly Winks;
    If you will learn your A, B, C’s,
    You soon can read good books like these.
    The Tiddly Winks cry, “Ho, ho,”
    How many words do you REALLY know?
    One hundred or more, can you answer “Yes”?
    Or do you read your books BY GUESS?




FOREWORD


The Tiddly Winks are good natured little fairies who teach lessons of
thrift and good cheer. Here we meet Tiddly Winks, Tiddly Wee, Tiddly
Thrift, Tiddly Cheer-Up, Tiddly Scowl, and Tiddly Why, all having the
characteristics of real children.

Who would not take delight in learning their A, B, C’s with the Tiddly
Winks?

A story of the Wee People—for Wee People, written in charming and simple
style, to be used in school and home as a first reader, carefully graded
with repetition of simple words and phrases.

Objects in the school room take a lively interest in the Tiddly Winks,
find voices, and even the School Bell outside remarks,

    “Hear my song, hear my rhyme,
    Hurry children, be on time.”

If you still inquire, “Who are the Tiddly Winks?” we will let them reply
in their own fashion,

    “Who are we? Who are we?
    Tiddly Winks as all can see;
    We are a very merry band,
    And we come from Fairyland.”

    “WHEN YOU CLOSE THIS LITTLE BOOK
    OPEN IT AGAIN AND LOOK,
    HOW MANY LESSONS CAN YOU READ?
    IF YOU SAY ‘ALL’ YOU’RE WISE INDEED!”

    A greeting from the Tiddly Winks,
    May be in pencil, or in ink,
    Each Tiddly Winks will be your friend,
    From the beginning to the end!
    They learn so many things from you,
    And little tricks they like to do,
    If you learn things from them, they say,
    We’ll call again another day!

    Tiddly Winks can you read?
    Then you are very wise indeed,
    Put on spectacles if you need,
    Work with a will and you’ll succeed.
